### Unit 3.1: Mining Time Series Data

#### 3.1.1 Introduction to Time Series Data

**Time Series Data** refers to data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals. It is ubiquitous in various domains such as finance, weather forecasting, stock market analysis, and healthcare. The analysis of time series data involves understanding the underlying patterns and predicting future values based on past observations.

**Key Characteristics of Time Series Data**:
- **Temporal Ordering**: Data points are ordered by time.
- **Trend**: The long-term progression or movement in the data.
- **Seasonality**: Regular and predictable patterns or cycles in data.
- **Noise**: Random variability in the data.
- **Stationarity**: A time series whose statistical properties such as mean, variance, and autocorrelation are constant over time.

#### 3.1.2 Techniques for Mining Time Series Data

**1. Trend Analysis**:
   - **Objective**: Identify and model the underlying trend in the data.
   - **Methods**:
     - **Moving Averages**: Smooths out short-term fluctuations and highlights longer-term trends.
       - Simple Moving Average (SMA): `SMA = (1/N) * sum(x_i from t-N+1 to t)`
     - **Exponential Smoothing**: Gives more weight to recent observations.
       - Exponential Smoothing: `S_t = α * x_t + (1 - α) * S_{t-1}`, where `0 < α < 1` is the smoothing factor.
     - **Polynomial Fitting**: Fits a polynomial equation to the data to capture the trend.
       - Polynomial Fitting: `y = β_0 + β_1 * x + β_2 * x^2 + ... + β_n * x^n`

**2. Seasonality Analysis**:
   - **Objective**: Detect and model seasonal patterns.
   - **Methods**:
     - **Seasonal Decomposition**: Decomposes a time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components.
       - Decomposition: `x_t = T_t + S_t + R_t`, where `T_t` is the trend component, `S_t` is the seasonal component, and `R_t` is the residual component.
     - **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)**: Measures the correlation between observations at different lags to identify seasonal patterns.

**3. Periodicity Analysis**:
   - **Objective**: Identify periodic patterns in the data.
   - **Methods**:
     - **Fourier Transform**: Converts time series data from the time domain to the frequency domain to identify dominant frequencies.
       - Fourier Transform: `X(f) = ∫(x(t) * e^{-2πi * f * t} dt)`
     - **Wavelet Transform**: Provides both time and frequency information by decomposing the time series into wavelets.

**4. Similarity Search**:
   - **Objective**: Find time series or subsequences that are similar to a given query.
   - **Methods**:
     - **Euclidean Distance**: Measures the straight-line distance between two time series.
       - Euclidean Distance: `d(x, y) = sqrt(sum((x_i - y_i)^2 from i=1 to n))`
     - **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**: Measures similarity by allowing for elastic shifts in the time axis.
       - DTW: `DTW(x, y) = min_{π} sqrt(sum((x_{π(i)} - y_i)^2 from i=1 to n))`, where `π` is a warping path that aligns the two series.
     - **Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS)**: Finds the longest subsequence that is common to both time series, allowing for gaps.

#### 3.1.3 Time Series Models

**1. Autoregressive (AR) Model**:
   - **Concept**: Predicts future values based on past values.
   - **Equation**: `x_t = φ_1 * x_{t-1} + φ_2 * x_{t-2} + ... + φ_p * x_{t-p} + ε_t`, where `φ` are the coefficients and `ε_t` is white noise.

**2. Moving Average (MA) Model**:
   - **Concept**: Predicts future values based on past forecast errors.
   - **Equation**: `x_t = ε_t + θ_1 * ε_{t-1} + θ_2 * ε_{t-2} + ... + θ_q * ε_{t-q}`, where `θ` are the coefficients and `ε_t` is white noise.

**3. Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) Model**:
   - **Concept**: Combines AR and MA models and includes differencing to make the time series stationary.
   - **Equation**: `(1 - φ_1 * B - φ_2 * B^2 - ... - φ_p * B^p) * (1 - B)^d * x_t = (1 + θ_1 * B + θ_2 * B^2 + ... + θ_q * B^q) * ε_t`, where `B` is the backshift operator.

**4. Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA) Model**:
   - **Concept**: Extends ARIMA to handle seasonal patterns.
   - **Equation**: `(1 - φ_1 * B - ... - φ_p * B^p) * (1 - Φ_1 * B^s - ... - Φ_P * B^{Ps}) * (1 - B)^d * (1 - B^s)^D * x_t = (1 + θ_1 * B + ... + θ_q * B^q) * (1 + Θ_1 * B^s + ... + Θ_Q * B^{Qs}) * ε_t`

**5. Exponential Smoothing State Space Model (ETS)**:
   - **Concept**: Captures error, trend, and seasonality components in the data.
   - **Equation**: `x_t = (l_t + b_t) * s_{t-m} + ε_t`, where `l_t` is the level, `b_t` is the trend, and `s_{t-m}` is the seasonal component.

#### 3.1.4 Applications of Time Series Analysis

**1. Financial Market Analysis**:
   - Predicting stock prices, market indices, and other financial metrics.
   - Example: Forecasting the closing price of a stock based on historical price data.

**2. Weather Forecasting**:
   - Predicting weather conditions such as temperature, precipitation, and wind speed.
   - Example: Forecasting next week's temperature based on historical weather data.

**3. Sales Forecasting**:
   - Predicting future sales for inventory management and business planning.
   - Example: Estimating next month's sales for a retail store based on past sales data.

**4. Healthcare**:
   - Monitoring and predicting patient health metrics.
   - Example: Forecasting the number of hospital admissions based on historical data.

**5. Industrial Process Control**:
   - Monitoring and controlling manufacturing processes.
   - Example: Predicting equipment failures in a manufacturing plant based on sensor data.
