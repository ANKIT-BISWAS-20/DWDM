### Unit 2.1: Classification and Prediction

#### 2.1.1 Introduction to Classification

**Classification** is a data mining technique used to predict categorical labels for data points. The goal is to identify the class or category to which a new data point belongs, based on a training dataset containing data points whose class labels are known.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Training Set**: A dataset used to train the model, consisting of input-output pairs.
- **Test Set**: A dataset used to evaluate the performance of the model.
- **Class Label**: The categorical output that a model aims to predict.
- **Features**: The input variables used for making predictions.

#### 2.1.2 Classification Algorithms

**1. Decision Trees**:
   - **Structure**: Tree-like model of decisions.
   - **Components**: Nodes (tests on attributes), branches (outcomes of tests), leaves (class labels).
   - **Algorithm**: ID3, C4.5, CART.
   - **Advantages**: Easy to understand, handle both numerical and categorical data.
   - **Disadvantages**: Prone to overfitting, especially with complex trees.

**2. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**:
   - **Concept**: Classifies a data point based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors.
   - **Distance Metrics**: Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance.
   - **Advantages**: Simple, effective for small datasets.
   - **Disadvantages**: Computationally expensive, sensitive to irrelevant features.

**3. Naive Bayes**:
   - **Concept**: Probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem with the assumption of feature independence.
   - **Types**: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Multinomial Naive Bayes, Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
   - **Advantages**: Fast, works well with large datasets and real-time predictions.
   - **Disadvantages**: Assumption of independence may not hold true in practice.

**4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
   - **Concept**: Finds the optimal hyperplane that separates data points of different classes.
   - **Kernel Trick**: Transforms data into higher dimensions to find the hyperplane.
   - **Advantages**: Effective in high-dimensional spaces, robust to overfitting.
   - **Disadvantages**: Computationally intensive, requires careful tuning of parameters.

**5. Neural Networks**:
   - **Structure**: Composed of input, hidden, and output layers.
   - **Algorithm**: Backpropagation for training.
   - **Advantages**: Can model complex patterns, suitable for large datasets.
   - **Disadvantages**: Requires large amounts of data and computational resources, risk of overfitting.

#### 2.1.3 Evaluation Metrics

**1. Accuracy**: The proportion of correctly classified instances out of the total instances.
   \[
   \text{Accuracy} = \frac{\text{Number of Correct Predictions}}{\text{Total Number of Predictions}}
   \]

**2. Precision**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions.
   \[
   \text{Precision} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Positives}}
   \]

**3. Recall**: The proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positives.
   \[
   \text{Recall} = \frac{\text{True Positives}}{\text{True Positives} + \text{False Negatives}}
   \]

**4. F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
   \[
   \text{F1 Score} = 2 \times \frac{\text{Precision} \times \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
   \]

**5. ROC-AUC (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)**: Measures the ability of the model to distinguish between classes.

#### 2.1.4 Introduction to Prediction

**Prediction** involves estimating the value of a continuous target variable based on input features. It differs from classification in that the output is a numerical value rather than a categorical label.

**Key Concepts**:
- **Regression**: A type of predictive modeling technique where the target variable is continuous.
- **Training and Test Data**: Similar to classification, the model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated on a separate test dataset.

#### 2.1.5 Prediction Algorithms

**1. Linear Regression**:
   - **Concept**: Models the relationship between the target variable and one or more input features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
   - **Equation**: \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_2 + \ldots + \beta_nx_n \)
   - **Advantages**: Simple to implement and interpret, fast.
   - **Disadvantages**: Assumes a linear relationship, sensitive to outliers.

**2. Polynomial Regression**:
   - **Concept**: Extends linear regression by considering polynomial relationships between the target variable and input features.
   - **Equation**: \( y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x + \beta_2x^2 + \ldots + \beta_nx^n \)
   - **Advantages**: Can model non-linear relationships.
   - **Disadvantages**: Risk of overfitting, especially with high-degree polynomials.

**3. Decision Trees**:
   - Used for both classification and regression tasks.
   - **Regression Trees**: Predict continuous values by splitting data into subsets based on the value of input features.

**4. Support Vector Regression (SVR)**:
   - **Concept**: Extension of SVM for regression tasks.
   - **Advantages**: Effective for high-dimensional spaces.
   - **Disadvantages**: Computationally intensive, sensitive to parameter settings.

**5. Neural Networks**:
   - **Concept**: Can be adapted for regression tasks by using appropriate activation functions and loss functions.
   - **Advantages**: Capable of modeling complex relationships.
   - **Disadvantages**: Requires large amounts of data and computational power.

#### 2.1.6 Evaluation Metrics for Prediction

**1. Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values.
   \[
   \text{MAE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |y_i - \hat{y_i}|
   \]

**2. Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: The average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values.
   \[
   \text{MSE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2
   \]

**3. Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: The square root of the mean squared error.
   \[
   \text{RMSE} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}
   \]

**4. R-Squared (R²)**: The proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
   \[
   R^2 = 1 - \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - \bar{y})^2}
   \]

#### Practical Applications

**1. Customer Classification**:
   - Identifying customer segments for targeted marketing campaigns.
   - Example: Classifying customers as high, medium, or low value based on purchasing behavior.

**2. Fraud Detection**:
   - Identifying fraudulent transactions in financial datasets.
   - Example: Classifying credit card transactions as legitimate or fraudulent.

**3. Medical Diagnosis**:
   - Predicting disease presence based on patient symptoms and history.
   - Example: Classifying tumor as benign or malignant based on diagnostic images.

**4. Sales Forecasting**:
   - Predicting future sales based on historical data and market trends.
   - Example: Estimating next quarter's sales revenue based on past sales and economic indicators.

**5. Stock Price Prediction**:
   - Estimating future stock prices based on historical prices and financial indicators.
   - Example: Predicting next month's stock price for a particular company using regression analysis.
