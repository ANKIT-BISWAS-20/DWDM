4. **Model Building**: Selecting and applying appropriate data mining algorithms.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assessing the model's performance and accuracy.
6. **Model Deployment**: Implementing the model in the real-world scenario.
7. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Regularly updating the model to maintain its accuracy and relevance.

#### 1.2.4 Key Concepts in Data Mining

**1. Data Cleaning and Integration**:
   - **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and removing duplicates.
   - **Data Integration**: Combining data from different sources, ensuring data consistency.

**2. Data Selection and Transformation**:
   - **Data Selection**: Choosing relevant data for analysis from the integrated dataset.
   - **Data Transformation**: Normalizing, aggregating, and encoding data to fit the model requirements.

**3. Pattern Discovery**:
   - Techniques to identify patterns, correlations, and trends in the data.
   - Utilizes machine learning algorithms to automate the pattern discovery process.

**4. Knowledge Representation**:
   - Visualizing the discovered patterns using charts, graphs, and dashboards.
   - Simplifies the interpretation of complex data for decision-makers.

#### 1.2.5 Common Data Mining Algorithms

**1. Decision Trees**:
   - A tree-like model used for classification and regression.
   - **Components**: Nodes (tests on attributes), branches (outcomes of the tests), leaves (class labels or continuous values).
   - **Popular Algorithms**: ID3, C4.5, CART.

**2. Naive Bayes**:
   - A probabilistic classifier based on Bayes' theorem.
   - Assumes independence between predictors.
   - Effective for large datasets and real-time predictions.

**3. k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN)**:
   - A simple, instance-based learning algorithm.
   - Classifies a data point based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors.

**4. Support Vector Machines (SVM)**:
   - A powerful classification method that finds the optimal hyperplane separating classes.
   - Effective for high-dimensional data and works well for both linear and non-linear data.

**5. k-Means Clustering**:
   - A partitioning method to divide the dataset into k distinct, non-overlapping subsets.
   - Iteratively assigns data points to clusters and updates the centroids.

**6. Apriori Algorithm**:
   - Used for mining frequent itemsets and association rules.
   - Iteratively identifies frequent itemsets using a level-wise search.
